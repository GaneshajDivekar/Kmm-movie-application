- [PreCompose](https://github.com/Tlaster/PreCompose) - Compose Multiplatform Navigation && State Management
- [Ktor Client](https://ktor.io/docs/welcome.html) - Ktor includes a multiplatform asynchronous HTTP client, which allows you to make requests and handle responses.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more.
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.

## Project structure

This Compose Multiplatform project includes three modules:

### [`shared`](/shared)
This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications, the code you share between platforms.

This shared module is also where you write your Compose Multiplatform code. In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.
It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`. The shared module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

### [`androidApp`](/androidApp)
This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.

### [`iosApp`](/iosApp)
This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as a CocoaPods dependency.
